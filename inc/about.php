<div class="container about footerStyle">
<p>This simple page was made to test PHP settings - Database connectivity, some light bootstrap and just to freshen up what I've learned through various tutorials.</p>
<p>

  <ul>
    Current TO-DO:
    <li> Set up "tracks/routes" table, connect via mysqli</li>
    <li> Add a user log in validation form</li>
    <li> Tidy up Bootstrap code</li>
    <li> Include javascript where possible</li>
  </ul>

</p>
<p>Tracks/Routes should eventually be placed in the databse from every registered user - unregistred users should be able to view routes, sort them by length,
difficulty, location, maybe some sort of description..</p>
